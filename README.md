## Team RMaD
### Overview

Welcome to RMaD - a database application that allows you to keep track of all your packages. With this application, you can send calendar invites for updates on your packages, view a database of all your packages up to six months, arrange your packages by carrier, and even get alerts and emails when your packages are arriving.

This application can accommodate up to 10 users and allows you to create user groups to easily notify and send out updates to multiple people.

Written in C# using [.NETFramework v. 4.6.1 and 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/visual-studio-sdks?cid=getdotnetsdk) and the [Trackhive API](https://www.trackhive.co/), this application uses the SQLite database to store and manage all your package information.

To use this application, you will need to have the SQLite engine installed on your system. You can find instructions on how to install the SQLite engine here.

Once you have the SQLite engine installed, you can clone this repository and run the application on your local machine.

We hope you enjoy using the Parcel Tracker and never lose track of your packages again!
